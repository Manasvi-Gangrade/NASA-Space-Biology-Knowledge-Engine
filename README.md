NASA Space Biology Knowledge Engine

The NASA Space Biology Knowledge Engine is an AI-powered research intelligence platform designed to transform how scientific knowledge is accessed, explored, and utilized for space mission planning. This project focuses on organizing and summarizing complex scientific literature into structured, interactive insights to support decision-making for future human space exploration, including Moon and Mars missions.

The system processes and analyzes a curated dataset of 608 NASA space biology research publications, extracting key themes, findings, and relationships across multiple biological domains such as microgravity effects, radiation exposure, human physiology, and life support systems. Using artificial intelligence and knowledge graph methodologies, the platform converts unstructured research documents into a connected knowledge network that enables faster discovery of relevant information and cross-domain insights.

A core component of the project is an interactive web-based dashboard that provides intuitive visualizations, publication summaries, and relationship mapping between research topics. The interface is designed to make complex scientific data accessible not only to researchers but also to mission planners, engineers, and interdisciplinary teams working on long-duration spaceflight challenges. By reducing the time required to manually review large volumes of literature, the platform improves research accessibility and accelerates knowledge-driven innovation.

From a technical perspective, the project integrates Python-based data processing pipelines, natural language processing (NLP) techniques for automated summarization, and knowledge graph construction to represent semantic relationships between concepts. Modern web development frameworks are used to deliver a responsive user experience, while data visualization tools enable interactive exploration of research trends and insights.

This repository demonstrates the application of AI and knowledge engineering in scientific domains where information density is high and decision timelines are critical. Beyond space biology, the architecture can be extended to other research-intensive fields such as healthcare, climate science, and engineering knowledge management.

Overall, the NASA Space Biology Knowledge Engine highlights how artificial intelligence can bridge the gap between large-scale scientific data and practical mission planning needs, contributing toward safer and more informed human space exploration.**Use your preferred IDE**
